Bioengineer (2013), MSc in Engineering (2017), and PhD in Electronics Engineering and Computer Science (2021) by the University of Antioquia (UdeA). I am currently professor in Physics department of the University of Antioquia and member of the research groups in Bioinstrumentation and Clinical Engineering and, Microelectronics and Scientific Instrumentation of the same University in Medell√≠n, Colombia.

My research activity focuses on biomedical signal processing and medical wearable medical devices design for monitoring critical patients, bioelectromagnetism, scientific instrumentation, high performance electronics design, signal conditioning and embedded systems development.

I have been involved in different projects of biomedical technologies development mainly based on remote monitoring of vital signs. In one of them, a vital signs monitor was developed for transportation of patient, which had to transmit vital signs such as electrocardiography, photoplethysmography, and non-invasive blood pressure from the patient to the sending and receiving care center in real time.

On the other hand, I developed a wearable monitoring device for ECG, PPG and NIBP acquisition from a device installed in a garment. Some algorithms were developed for the conditioning of the signals and the motion artifacts reduction.

During the SARS-COV2 pandemic in the year 2020-2021, I was involved in the development of a mechanical ventilator to supply the deficiency of this equipment in Medell√≠n Colombia. We called this initiative InnspiraMED and We managed to develop 3 prototypes of mechanical ventilators which are in the process of obtaining a health certificate from INVIMA, the regulatory entity for medical technology in Colombia.

Currently I am participating as a collaborator member on Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) at Fermilab and CERN from the Universidad de Antioquia, I am working as a firmware developer for microcontroller systems, Real Time Operative System architect and Hardware designer for the experiment. DUNE experiment is searching for evidence about the Charge Parity violation in the Standard Model in High Energy Physics, measuring events produced by the interaction of Neutrinos with matter to determine their characteristics including mass, origin, energy among others.

I consider myself a person with the ability to lead research and development processes, and at the same time be part of a team and work together with other people to execute assigned tasks. I have skills in the development of algorithms in Python and MATLAB for the acquisition and processing of biomedical signals, the development of web applications from the Backend to the Frontend, the electronic design of high performance with tools such as Eagle and Altium, and the design of algorithms for embedded systems and microcontrollers with C.
